// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, color?: string, feature?: string) {
    let car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model,
        color: color,
        feature: feature
    }
    return car;
}

console.log(createCar("Toyota", "Camry", "red", "sunroof"));
