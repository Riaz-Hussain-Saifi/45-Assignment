// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:

// • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?

// • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.

const users = ['admin', 'user1', 'user2', 'user3', 'user4', 'user5'];

for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    if (users[i] === 'admin') {
        console.log(`Hello ${users[i]}, would you like to see a status report?`);
    } else {
        console.log(`Hello ${users[i]}, thank you for logging in again.`);
    }
}
