// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestList: string[] = ["Sheraz", "Waqas", "Asad", "Liaqat"];

for (let i = 0; i < guestList.length; i++) {
    console.log("Hi, " + guestList[i] + ", I would like to invite you to dinner.");
}
